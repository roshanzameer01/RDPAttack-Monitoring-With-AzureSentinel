# Real-Time RDP Attack Geolocation with Azure Sentinel and PowerShell

üéØ **Objective**: In this project, I monitored live RDP brute force attacks on a honeypot virtual machine, extracted attacker data, and mapped geolocation information using PowerShell and Azure Sentinel.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Used**
- **PowerShell**: Script to parse Windows Event Logs and extract failed RDP attempts.
- **ipgeolocation.io**: API to fetch geographic details of attacking IP addresses.
- **Azure Sentinel**: SIEM tool to visualize attack data and geolocation on a map.

üß† **Skills Learned**
- Configuring a honeypot VM for security monitoring.
- Writing PowerShell scripts to interact with Windows Event Logs and external APIs.
- Using Azure Sentinel for real-time data analysis and visualization.
- Mapping geolocation data to understand the geographic distribution of attacks.

## üìù Steps

1. **Preparation**
   - Set up Azure Sentinel and connect it to a honeypot VM.
   - Installed necessary PowerShell modules for scripting and API interaction.

2. **Observation**
   - Analyzed failed RDP attempts captured in Windows Event Logs.
   - Recognized patterns and frequency of attacks from various regions.

3. **Using PowerShell**
   - **Extracting Event Log Data**:
     - Parsed Windows Event Logs for failed RDP attempts using PowerShell.
   - **Geolocation Lookup**:
     - Used ipgeolocation.io API to fetch geographic information of attacker IPs.
   - **Custom Log Creation**:
     - Created custom logs with geodata and visualized them in Azure Sentinel.

4. **Visualization in Azure Sentinel**
   - **Map Setup**:
     - Configured Azure Sentinel to display geolocation data on a map.
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**:
     - Monitored and visualized live RDP attacks, identifying geographic hotspots.
